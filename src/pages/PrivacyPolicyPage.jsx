      <p>Last updated: Feb 19, 2024</p>
      <p>Welcome to The Stoat Forum's Privacy Policy. Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
      <div className='privacy_policy_info__div'>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          When you visit our forum, we may collect certain information about you, including your name, email address, and any other information you
          choose to provide. Additionally, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web
          browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use the information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the forum, as well as to
          communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages, and to permit you to communicate with others on the forum or to
          participate in interactive features of the forum when you choose to do so.

      <div className='privacy_policy_info__div'>
        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with third parties for their commercial purposes, except to provide products or
          services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
            situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of The Stoat Forum's terms of use, or as otherwise
            required by law.
          </li>
          <li>
            We transfer information about you if The Stoat Forum is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, The Stoat Forum will
            notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div className='privacy_policy_info__div'>
        <h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the forum, in which case The Stoat Forum may not be able
          to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal information and email preferences at any time by logging in to
          your account.

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, The Stoat Forum does not knowingly collect or solicit
          personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us,
          including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or
          on The Stoat Forum. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of
          parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational,
          legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we
          may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).
